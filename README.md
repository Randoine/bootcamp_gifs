# bootcamp_gifs

Webapp which allows user to upload, view and to some extent, edit gif files.

Technologies and frameworks used:
- Spring MVC
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- Thymeleaf
- Materialize
- HTML5
- CSS

Main design and basic views and back-end functions were implemented during JAVA Bootcamp which I attended.
More advanced features added later by me:
- gif search function
- refactoring views using fragments
- integration with local database
- uploading new gifs
- CRUD for gifs and categories
